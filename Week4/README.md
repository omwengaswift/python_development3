# File Handling Challenges in Python

## Overview
This project contains two challenges combined into a single Python script:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è**
   - Reads the content of an input file.
   - Modifies the content (converts text to uppercase).
   - Writes the modified content into a new file.

2. **Error Handling Lab üß™**
   - Prompts the user for a file name.
   - Reads and displays its content.
   - Handles common errors such as:
     - File not found
     - Permission errors
     - Unexpected errors

## Features
- Uses **Python's `with` statement** for safe file handling.
- Implements **exception handling** for robust error management.
- Provides a **menu-based interface** to choose between tasks.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Save the script as `file_management_and_exception_handling.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python file_management_and_exception_handling.py
